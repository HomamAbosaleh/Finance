# Finance
This project was an assesment given by Harverd university's CS50 course.

The idea of this project is to make a simple website for stocks transactions. The stocks information are being fetch using an API and displayed to the user on search.

In order to use the website, one needs to sign up. The sign up page directly sign in the user if the sign up is correct.

After signing in, a couple of new tags will appear in the navigation bar. Morevoer, the user can log out and log in.

In the following videos, the user is capable of search the stock and getting its price, buying shares of any stock, selling shares of any stock, and reviewing his/her history of transactions.
